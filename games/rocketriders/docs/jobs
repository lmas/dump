Each player should belong to only one job
each job:

- has a primary, active role that affects the rest of the ship
- has at least two consoles for a main and a minor function
- needs a reason to run around the ship
- gives a passive buff to the other jobs (and itself)
- has specific events that focus on that job
- has a set of drones to perform a minor job specific function
- needs custom tiles for its console, wall sign and misc decorations
