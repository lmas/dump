Make Prison Station and you'll be both the hero the community needs and the one it deserves.

A place where power-gaming shitlords who wanna self-antag and HRPers who want a dramatic hugbox can finally coexist, and the majority of us in between can watch an elaborate metaphor for the community itself unfold over the course of a round!

Either play as a prisoner and join the chaos, or play as prison staff and talk about how to deal with it from the safety of not inside the prison and let the HRP unfold. The true god-tier RPers can play as Therapists and hold self-help seminars with prisoners if they prefer a shankbox over a hugbox.

The prison itself should be good enough that it's insanely hard to escape, but bad enough that the orangetide makes the greytide look well behaved. Make as many jobs for prisoners only as possible and use the loadout feature to let everyone start with some contraband, so that prisoners actually can fuck around. Just make it legit hard for them to get out (after all, some fucko will still find a way. It's SS13!).

Throw in a Clown gang, a lizard gang, and a human supremacist gang as prisoner jobs along with the other jobs and it's basically fucking art at that point, as far as I'm concerned.
