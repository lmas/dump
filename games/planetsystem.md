dont count stars with lower classes, they don't fuse hydrogen (brown dwarfs)
- inner region of small rocky planets
- outer region of gas giants
- not hard limits (hot gas giants close to star is possible)

high mass stars:
- planets or accretion disks around pulsars (after supernova)

low mass stars:
- evaporates inner planets (when evolved to red giants etc)
- surviving outer planets move further out from star

habitable zones
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- where temp is just right for liquid water to exist on a planet
- depends on the heat of a star (age, size, luminosity)
- generally the lower the star class, closer is the zone to the star

metallicities
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- "amount of elements that's not hydrogen/helium"

- low-metal:
- old stars
- has more small planets and lack of gas giants
- is common near the galactic center and out in the galactic halo

- high-metal:
- young stars
- between the galactic center and the outer rings
- overall more planets around high-metal stars
- has more gas giants
- amount of gas giants 9.30 times higher
- amount of gas dwarfs 2.03 times higher
- amount of terrestrial planets 1.72 times higher

planets
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- hydrogen, helium referred to as "gases"
- water, methane, ammonia as "ices"
- silicates, metals as "rock"

- at least 1 planet per star (but there are exceptions)
- small planets (about earth size) more common than gas giants
- more planets in large orbits, than small orbits
- planets common around class F, G, K stars
- smaller planets around class M dwarfs
- planets around class A giants rotate quickly, uncommon to have planets at all
- no planets around superhot class O (but can have accretion disks)

- rocky planets:
- exists in the inner 3-4 AU disc (within the frost line), of a sun like star (class G)
- mostly solid rock
- between 1km in diameter and 1000km
- on average 2 to 5 planets of this type
- mass up to 0.1 M
- mass up to 1 Me (mass of earth)
- few or no moons, no rings

- types of rock planets:
- silicate: silicon-based rocky mantle, metallic core
- iron: up to 60-70% of the mass, more common near the star and it's high temp
- coreless (theoretical): silicate rock but with no metallic core
- carbon (theoretical): metallic core surrounded by carbon-based minerals

- giants:
- formed beyond the frost line (5 AU to 30 AU)
- up to 100 moons, usually have a ring
- consists mainly of a combination of hydrogen, helium, water in various phys. states
- when big enough (5-10 Me), they begin to gather gas (up to 30 Me) for a few
  million years, and then during 10k years they might grow up to 300 Me

- types of giants:
- gas: mostly hydrogen, helium. probably molten, rock core
- ice: hydrogen-rich atmos (about 80% of the radious), but mostly water,methane,
  ammonia "ices"
- rock: able to form around massive stars (5-120 M)

circumstellar disc ("asteroid belt")
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- common around young stars
- multiple disks per system (solar system has 4, for example)
- occupied mainly by asteroids and minor planets

- stages:
- protoplanetary disc has large amounts of gas and dust, massive enough to form planets
- transition disc reduced presence of gas and dust
- debris disc has small or no amounts of gas, mostly only dust

- binary systems:
- circumprimary disc around main star
- cirumsecondary around second, less massive star
- circumbinary disc around both stars

asteroids
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- sizes larger than 100km (about 200 in solar system) and down to 1km (millions)
- Tholen classification (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroid_spectral_types)

- c-types:
- about 75% of the whole population of the belt
- consist mainly of carbon
- dominates outer regions of a belt
- more red in hue than other types

- s-types:
- about 17%
- mainly silicates
- more common in the inner region of the belt

- m-types:
- about 10%
- mainly metallic

TODO: 
- more types that need to be added (just population, composition and looks)
  see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroid_spectral_types for more
